# STAGEPASS – HIGH LEVEL DESIGN (HLD)

# Full-Stack QR Based Event Ticketing Platform

# Tech Stack: Next.js (Frontend + Backend)

============================================================

1. SYSTEM OVERVIEW

StagePass is a full-stack, QR-based event ticketing platform built entirely using Next.js.
The system enables secure ticket purchasing, QR code generation, and real-time validation
at event entry points. The architecture is designed to be scalable, secure, and production-ready.

The platform supports multiple roles:

* Attendees (Users)
* Event Organizers
* Event Staff / Scanners
* Admin

============================================================

2. DESIGN GOALS

* Prevent fake or duplicate ticket usage
* Ensure one-time QR validation
* Provide fast entry verification
* Centralize event and ticket management
* Support future scalability (payments, analytics, offline scan)

============================================================

3. ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW (NEXT.JS FULL STACK)

StagePass uses a unified Next.js architecture:

[ Client (Browser / Mobile) ]
|
| HTTPS + JWT
v
[ Next.js App Router ]
|
| Server Actions / API Routes
v
[ Business Logic Layer ]
|
v
[ Database (PostgreSQL / MongoDB) ]

============================================================

4. FRONTEND DESIGN (NEXT.JS APP ROUTER)

4.1 Frontend Responsibilities

* User authentication (login/signup)
* Event discovery and browsing
* Ticket purchase UI
* QR ticket display
* Organizer dashboard
* Staff QR scanner interface

4.2 Frontend Pages Structure

/app
├── page.tsx                 -> Landing page
├── login/page.tsx           -> Login
├── register/page.tsx        -> Signup
├── events/page.tsx          -> Browse events
├── events/[id]/page.tsx     -> Event details & purchase
├── tickets/page.tsx         -> My tickets
├── dashboard/organizer      -> Organizer dashboard
├── dashboard/scanner        -> QR scanner UI
├── dashboard/admin          -> Admin panel

4.3 Frontend Components

/components
├── Navbar
├── EventCard
├── TicketCard
├── QRDisplay
├── QRScanner
├── ProtectedRoute

4.4 State Management

* Auth state via JWT (HTTP-only cookies)
* Server Components for data fetching
* Client Components only where interactivity is required

============================================================

5. BACKEND DESIGN (NEXT.JS SERVER)

Backend logic is implemented using:

* API Routes (/app/api)
* Server Actions
* Middleware

5.1 Backend Responsibilities

* Authentication & authorization
* Ticket generation
* QR encryption and validation
* Role-based access control
* Event & ticket management

5.2 API Route Structure

/app/api
├── auth/login
├── auth/register
├── events/create
├── events/list
├── events/[id]
├── tickets/purchase
├── tickets/validate
├── tickets/my
├── admin/users

============================================================

6. AUTHENTICATION & AUTHORIZATION

6.1 Authentication

* JWT-based authentication
* Tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies
* Middleware for protected routes

6.2 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Roles:

* USER: Buy & view tickets
* ORGANIZER: Create events, view sales
* STAFF: Scan and validate tickets
* ADMIN: Full access

============================================================

7. DATABASE DESIGN (HIGH LEVEL)

7.1 User Table

* id
* name
* email
* password_hash
* role
* created_at

7.2 Event Table

* id
* title
* description
* date_time
* venue
* organizer_id
* ticket_limit

7.3 Ticket Table

* id
* user_id
* event_id
* qr_hash
* is_used
* used_at
* created_at

7.4 Scan Logs Table

* id
* ticket_id
* scanned_by
* scanned_at
* scan_status

============================================================

8. QR CODE DESIGN

* QR code contains encrypted ticket ID
* No plain user or event data exposed
* Validation always happens server-side

QR Validation Rules:

1. Ticket exists
2. Ticket belongs to the event
3. Ticket is unused
4. Scanner has permission

============================================================

9. TICKET PURCHASE FLOW

User -> Select Event -> Checkout -> Ticket Created
-> QR Generated -> Stored in DB -> Displayed to User

============================================================

10. TICKET SCANNING FLOW

Scan QR -> API Validation -> Decrypt QR
-> Check Ticket Status -> Mark Used -> Return Result

Possible Responses:

* VALID
* INVALID
* ALREADY USED

============================================================

11. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

* HTTPS only
* Encrypted QR payloads
* One-time ticket usage
* RBAC protected APIs
* Rate limiting on scan endpoints

============================================================

12. SCALABILITY & PERFORMANCE

* Stateless server design
* Database indexing
* Redis caching (future)
* Horizontal scaling using containers

============================================================

13. DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY

* Frontend + Backend: Next.js (Vercel)
* Database: Managed PostgreSQL / MongoDB
* Redis: Optional caching layer
* QR scanning devices authenticated via JWT

============================================================

14. FUTURE EXTENSIONS

* Payment gateway integration
* Seat-based ticketing
* Offline scanning mode
* Analytics dashboard
* Ticket transfer system

============================================================

15. CONCLUSION

StagePass is designed as a modern, secure, and scalable QR-based ticketing platform.
This HLD serves as a long-term technical reference for development, scaling,
and production deployment.
